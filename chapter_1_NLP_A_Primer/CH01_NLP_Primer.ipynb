    "计算机只能理解0和1，所以NLP 的主要问题是，怎么样将自然语言以0和1的形式给程序，并理解。\n",
    "NLP deals with methods to analyze, model, and understand human language\n",

    "### 1.1 NLP applications\n",
    "- **Email platforms**: spam classification, priority inbox, calendar event extraction, auto-complete, etc. \n",
    "- **Voice-based assistants**: interact with the user, understand user commands, and respond accordingly.\n",
    "- **Search engine**: query understanding, query expansion, question answering, information retrieval, and ranking and grouping of the results\n",
    "- **machine translation**\n",
    "- **social media**: sentimental analysis\n",
    "- **E-Commerce platforms**: understanding customer reviews\n",
    "- **Text generation**: reports\n",
    "- **Spelling check**\n",
    "- **Plagiarism detection**\n",
    "- **Build large knowledge bases**: knowledge base / graph is used for search and QA.\n",
    "- many others...\n",

    "### 1.2 NLP tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "上述NLP 问题大多可以分解成以下tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language modeling:\n",
    "    - The goal of this task is to learn the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a given language.\n",
    "    - 使用场景: speech recognition, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), handwriting recognition, machine translation, spelling correction, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text classification\n",
    "    - 使用场景: email spam identification, sentiment analysis\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Information extraction\n",
    "    - 使用场景: calendar events, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Information retrieval\n",
    "    - This is the task of finding documents relevant to a user query from a large collection. \n",
    "    - 使用场景: Google search\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Conversational agent\n",
    "    - Siri, Alexa, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text summarization\n",
    "    - Create short summaries of longer documents while retaining the core content and preserving the overall meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question answering\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine translation\n",
    "    - 使用场景: Google translate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topic modeling\n",
    "    - This is the task of uncovering the topical structure of a large collection of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "下面，我们按这些task 的复杂度进行排序\n",

    "<img src=\"../figures/1-3.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 phonemes\n",
    "important in speech understanding.\n",
    "- smallest units of sound\n",
    "- may not have meaning\n",
    "- can induce meanings: un, in, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 morphemes and lexemes\n",
    "A morpheme is the smallest unit of language that has a meaning. multimedia, multi is a morpheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/1-5.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexemes are the structural variations of morphemes related to one another by meaning. “run” and “running” belong to the same lexeme form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 syntax\n",
    "Syntax is a set of rules to construct grammatically correct sentences out of words and phrases in a language.\n",
    "syntactic structure 通常用一个parsing tree 来表示(**N** stands for noun, **V** for verb, and **P** for preposition, Noun phrase is denoted by **NP** and verb phrase by **VP**).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/1-6.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
