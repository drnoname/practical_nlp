# Contributing

We strongly believe open sourcing projects for contributions is one of the best ways to improve the qulaity of the project. We are etternally thankful to our readers for pointing out typographical errors and bugs. If youâ€™re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. We want to make your contribution experience as smooth as possible.<br>

If you find a typographical error in the book text, kindly open a errata via this link:
[https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920262329](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920262329)

If you find a bug in the code notebooks or want to add a new notebook we prefer that you open an issue in this repo. In the issue please provide us details about the bug such as notebook link, python version, error(including full traceback) and where your running the notebook(local or colab). You can find the ISSUES Template [here](https://github.com/practical-nlp/practical-nlp/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
<br>

From here you can do one of two these two things:
1. Wait for us to fix the bug.
2. Fix the bug yourself and send a pull request.<br>
We highly encourage you to fix the bug yourself and send a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1. Please open an issue first.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Clone the forked repository.
4. You can start working on making the necessary changes.
5. When your done, push the changes to your forked repository.
6. Head to the forked repository and click on a Compare & pull request button.
5. Add short yet descriptive and easy to understand descriptions for all the changes you make.
<br>
We will soon be adding a PULL REQUESTS Template.<br>
